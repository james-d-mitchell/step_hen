README - step_hen - by James D. Mitchell and Maria Tsalakou
***********************************************************

``step_hen`` contains a rudimentary implementation of three algorithms of J. B.
Stephen and Andrew Cutting for finitely presented monoids and inverse monoids
in python3. These algorithms can be used to check equality of a fixed word
with any other word in a finitely presented monoid, or inverse monoid, and to
compute the structure of a finitely presented inverse monoid. 

The implementation is rudimentary because it lacks many obvious optimisations
and improvements, it is intended as a simple proof of concept.

The algorithms are described in the following:
