README - stephen - by James D. Mitchell and Maria Tsalakou
**********************************************************

``stephen`` contains a rudimentary implementation of three algorithms of J. B.
Stephen for finitely presented monoids and inverse monoids in python3. These
algorithms are can be used to check equality of a fixed word with any other
word in a finitely presented monoid, or inverse monoid, and to compute the
structure of a finitely presented inverse monoid. 

The implementation is rudimentary because it lacks many obvious optimisations
and improvements, it is intended as a simple proof of concept.

The algorithms are described in the following papers:

* J. B. Stephen, "Presentations of inverse monoids", *J. Pure Appl. Algebra*,
  **63** (1990) 81--112; `<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-4049(90)90057-O>`_

* J. B. Stephen, "Applications of automata theory to presentations of monoids
  and inverse monoids", The University of Nebraska - Lincoln (1987).
