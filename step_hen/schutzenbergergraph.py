    a finitely presented inverse monoid as a fixed word.

    Generators are represented by lower case letters and their inverses by
    upper case letters.

        Returns ``True`` if ``word`` is accepted by the Schutzenberger graph.
        This means that the paths starting at the first node ``0`` labelled by
        the representative and ``word`` are both defined and end at the same
        node.

        Two words in the free monoid are equal, in the finitely presented
        inverse monoid used to construct the Schutzenberger graph, if and only
